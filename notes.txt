__Goal:

  to Build a simple json-based CMS with an MVC structure using Twig for views templating.

__Walkthru(current state):

  1. all requests are directed to index.php via htaccess file
  
  2. index.php requires Router_Class.php & globals.php
  
    2a. Router_Class.php loads the Router_Class
    
    2b. globals.php loads some global variables like root & twigger paths
  
  3. index.php then includes the *_Controller.php files
  
    3a. requests for certain pages/content are handled by the controller files
    
    3b. each request handler in the controllers: 
      
      i. calls back to Router_Class function/s with a request(get, post, any),
      ii. requires the twigger loader(inits the twig global environment)
      iii. sets the context variables(ideally taking the data from defined models)
      iv. renders the twig template/s with the context
      
__Notes:

  Controllers will be made for different types of requests. Examples: Home_Controller to handle the homepage requests & data, Page_Controller to handle all other page-type requests(/about), Project_Controller to handle all project requests(/portfolio/web-design/organic)
  
  Ideally, in each controller request function, we will be taking data from the relevant model & sending it to the views
  
  Ideally, the model would then either define php data sets, or take data from json sets, & modifiy that for use in the views
  
  Ideally the models would define data objects/sets in terms of classes. An example of a class would be Page. The Page class could then be extended in other models(like post or project). A class would define the data of the object(page), with fields like name, slug etc. Methods would be written that take data from data sets. Controllers would refer to these methods when sending data to the views.

__Potential site structure(permalinks):

  Homepage -> /

  pages -> /about, /about/services, /contact

  posts:
    
    archives:
      
      base -> /blog
      
      category -> /blog/news
      
      categories -> /blog/categories
      
    singular -> /blog/news/lorem-ipsum

  projects:

    archives: 
    
      base -> /portfolio
      
      project-type -> /portfolio/web-design
      
      project-types -> /portfolio/project-types
    
    singular -> /portfolio/web-design/organic, /portfolio/graphic-design/solaris

__Potential data objects:

  global(data which should be available everywhere)
  
    site(single) -> title, tagline...
    theme -> project-name, project-start-date...
    menu/s(mutiple) -> menu1(title,items...), menu2(title,items...)
    user/owner(single) -> name, age, github-url...
    media/s(single) -> upload1(title, description, caption, alt...), upload2(title, description, caption, alt...),
    
  terms(things to categorize by)
  
    category -> for posts
    project-type -> for projects
  
  singular(available to singular templates)
  
    page
    post:extends->page
    project:extends->post
    
  archives(available to archive templates)
  
    blog
    categories:extends->blog
    portfolio:extends->blog
    project-type:extends->portfolio
