to do...

1. query terms from taxes model & collection archive routes

2. orderby/sorting added to QueryModel

3. breadcrumbs working -> would be working off off _context array $variables/conditionals

4. full query params working off base_url. e.g: https://robertmccormack.com?type=post&year=2021

future improvements..

1. allow multiple types in query string. e.g: type=post,project
