# Super Simple JSON CMS

A json-based, super-simple CMS with MVC architecture & Twig templating. This is made according to my personal preference for projects where a CMS system like Wordpress is overkill but where I would like to make use of some dynamic data & url routing. The eventual aim is to develop alongside a backend & database, but have options for switching between database & json-data sources (such as with an api).
